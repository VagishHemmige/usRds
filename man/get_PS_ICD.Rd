\title{Retrieve diagnosis claims from Physician/Supplier files by ICD code}
\usage{
get_PS_ICD(icd_codes = NULL, years, usrds_ids = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{icd_codes}{Optional. Character vector of ICD-9/10 diagnosis codes (without periods).
If \code{NULL}, returns all diagnosis claims for the selected years (filtered by \code{usrds_ids}, if specified).}

\item{years}{Integer vector of calendar years to include. Must match available years in the PS ICD file index.}

\item{usrds_ids}{Optional. Vector of USRDS_IDs to filter the data to specific patients.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per diagnosis claim, containing:
\describe{
\item{USRDS_ID}{Patient ID}
\item{DIAG}{ICD diagnosis code (character)}
\item{CLM_FROM}{Claim start date (Date)}
\item{CLM_THRU}{Claim end date (Date)}
\item{HCFASAF}{Source file}
}
}
\description{
Extracts diagnosis-level claims from the USRDS Physician/Supplier (PS) billing files
for selected years and filters them by specified ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes and/or USRDS_IDs.
This function supports input files in Parquet, CSV, or SAS format and automatically
identifies and loads the correct files for each year using the internal USRDS file list.
}
\details{
When Parquet files are used, filtering by ICD code and USRDS_ID is applied
before collection for improved performance. For CSV and SAS files, filtering
occurs after reading the file into memory.

If \code{icd_codes} is \code{NULL}, all diagnosis claims for the specified years (and optionally,
specific USRDS_IDs) are returned.
